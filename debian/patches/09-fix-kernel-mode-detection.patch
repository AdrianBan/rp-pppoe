Description: Fix kernel-mode detection
 Original configure contain an include of netinet/in.h which will duplicate
 the defined constants.
 .
 rp-pppoe (3.12-1.4) unstable; urgency=low
 .
   * Non-maintainer upload.
   * Add PPPoE Kernel mode.
   * Patch to remove netinet/in.h and linux/in.h from the tests
     because the if_pppox.h is already including in.h and in6.h
   * Removed the pppoe-server scripts. There is a separate packages
     named pppoe-server which provides systemd bootup services.
